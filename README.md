The Global Superstore Dashboard is a dynamic dashboard design that highlights sales and profits for a global store. Details are given by country, region, and city, as well as by product category and sub-category. This level of detail means that users can determine the cities where, for example, mobile phone cases are making the highest profits and those cities where they do not sell as well.  
Click on any of the countries or regions to update the sales of each region wise giving full control of the data. This dynamic updating also means that you can get rid of redundant data. Need to know whether a sales of product is selling well as per year company making profit or not .This is a well-organized and dynamic dashboard that looks good and makes it easy to ignore irrelevant information and data.
